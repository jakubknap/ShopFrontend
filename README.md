# Ecommerce Shop
> This is a fullstack online store project. The application includes the basic functions of an online store, as well as those that are a bit more advanced.  There is integration with a payment gateway in this application, sending emails and much more.

The application in a nutshell has such functionalities:

On the administrative side:
- Add, edit and delete products.
- Add, edit and delete categories
- Order management, including exporting orders to CSV file and viewing sales statistics in the form of a chart
- Moderation of user reviews (approval, deletion)

From the user side:
- Viewing products
- Searching for products by category
- Creating orders (adding products to cart, deleting, ordering)
- Adding product reviews 
- Viewing the list of your orders
- Email notifications

In a nutshell, this is the outline of the application. There is also a mechanism for registration, login and password reminders.

I don't know how long the application will run, but there is a demo on display, available at: https://shopfrontend-production-f14c.up.railway.app/

And for the administrator: https://shopfrontend-production-f14c.up.railway.app/admin
- The default login is: admin
- Default password is: test
